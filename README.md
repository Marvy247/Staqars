# Staqars - Learning Clarity One dApp at a Time

This repository is a collection of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity smart contract language. The goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate various concepts of Clarity and dApp development by building individual, self-contained applications.

## dApps

This repository currently contains the following dApps:

*   **[Auction House](./auction-house/README.md)**: A decentralized auction house for NFTs.
*   **[Bounty System](./bounty-system/README.md)**: A system for creating and managing bounties.
*   **[BTC Bridge Helper](./btc-bridge-helper/README.md)**: A cross-chain messaging and formatting system for Bitcoin-Stacks interoperability.
*   **[Flash Loan](./flash-loan/README.md)**: An instant, collateral-free loan protocol.
*   **[Credential Registry](./credential-registry/README.md)**: A system to issue, verify, and manage digital credentials on-chain.
*   **[Insurance Pool](./insurance-pool/README.md)**: A decentralized risk pooling and claims management platform.
*   **[NFT Marketplace](./nft-marketplace/README.md)**: A decentralized NFT marketplace with creator royalties.

Each dApp is located in its own directory and contains its own set of contracts, tests, and deployment configurations. Please refer to the `README.md` file within each dApp's directory for more specific information.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the dApps in this repository, you will need to have [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed. Clarinet is a tool for developing, testing, and deploying Clarity smart contracts.

Once you have Clarinet installed, you can navigate to the directory of the dApp you are interested in and use the Clarinet CLI to interact with the contracts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an idea for a new dApp or want to improve an existing one, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
